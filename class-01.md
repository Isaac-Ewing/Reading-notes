Intro (HTML): Not very much was interesting here, the last couple pages gave a nice overview of accessing the web.

HTML CH 1: Basically just talking about basic HTML layout and then how to view the source code of a web page.

HTML CH 8: This section was actually sort of helpful. I wasn't clear on the use of class vs id and what exactly a div was, but that helped. Everything has a unique id, classes group things together, and div can keep multiple tags in a block. iframes are windows within web pages, and meta is hidden info about the page.

HTML CH 17: Talks about header and footer, kinda self explanitory. Nav is for something like a table of contents, I think. Article is tag for a piece of content that can stand alone from the rest of the page and be referenced. Aside is for holding info for an article or an entire page. Section is for content that is related to each other. hgroup is for grouping headers of multiple sizes together as one heading. Talked about how to handle older browsers.

HTML CH 18: This chapter goes over basic planning for a website, talking about motivation for visiting the website, target audience, stuff like that. Talks about visual hierarchy, which is basically just TLDR (too long, didn't read), gets the main point across quickly. It also talks about keeping similar stuff grouped together... this entire chapter is basically telling you how to not be an idiot and actaully consider what you're doing and why.

Intro (JS): Basically just talking about what you can do with programs and then it gave an overview of HTML and CSS.

JS CH 1: This is sort of like the HTML CH 18, its just telling you not to be the modern-day equivalent of a barbarian when coding. Have a plan, identify objectives, don't be an idiot. Great. There was some long hotel example but I didn't really read it, it was just going over basic stuff. The rest of the chapter goes over the relations between HTML, CSS, and JS. It's things we've been doing a lot, I don't really feel the need to summerize how to link a JS file or methods.
